7. **Document Parsing using PyTesseract**  
   This notebook provides a Python script to parse and extract structured data from an image using the pytesseract library. The script uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read text from images and applies regular expressions to identify and extract specific information, converting it into a structured JSON format.
